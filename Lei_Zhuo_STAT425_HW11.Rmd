## Question 1 
```{r}
data(fuel2001,package="alr4")
fit = lm(FuelC~Tax+Drivers+Income,data = fuel2001)
rstudent(fit)
```

## Question 2
```{r}
#Without Bonferroni adjustment
critval = qt(.05/(2),df = df.residual(fit)-1,lower = FALSE)
which(abs(rstudent(fit))>critval)
```
Florida, New York, and Texas are outliers.

```{r}
#Bonferroni adjustment
critval = qt(.05/(2*nobs(fit)),df = df.residual(fit)-1,lower = FALSE)
which(abs(rstudent(fit))>critval)
```
New York and Texas are identitifed as outliers.

## Question 3 
```{r}
which(cooks.distance(fit)>=1)
```
Cook's distance is used to measure the influence of a point. A point is an outlier if the cook's distance for that point is equal to or greater than 1. In this case, we have no outliers according to cook's distance. 

## Question 4
We know two things: $H = X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T$ and that when a matrix is multipled by its inverse, we get an identity matrix.

$HX = X(X^TX)^{-1}X^TX = XI$ since $(X^TX)^{-1}X^TX=I$. Thus, $HX=XI = X$ since multiplying by identity matrix is the same as multiplying by one.

$X^TH = X^TX(X^TX)^{-1}X^T = IX^T = X^T$ using the same logic as above.
